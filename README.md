# Honey Encryption in Java

In this code, I try to implement honey encryption method using Java to gain better understanding over how the technique works.
Basically this method takes user password and his/her personal data. The system then used user's password to generate honey words. Later on, it would prompt the user to enter the password. If honey words is being inputted, then it would raise a notice that an intruder had been found and then provide fake information to the intruder. However, if the user inputted the correct password then the system would produce correct data. 

Credit to: Victor Nguyen (https://github.com/victornguyen75/honey-encryption) for implementing the method in Python which I used as a guideline for this code.
